Entry Info:
- Adjusting WBS tasks
- Recording suggestions for additional feature

Additional Notes:

1. Recipe Builder

- Description: Allow users to select multiple foods and create a simple recipe by summing up their nutritional values. This feature could help users quickly see the total nutritional content of a meal made up of selected foods.
- How It Works:
Users select multiple foods from a list or search results.
The tool calculates the total calories, macronutrients (protein, fats, carbs), and any other relevant nutrients (e.g., fiber, vitamins) for the combination of selected foods.
Users can name and save the recipe for future reference.
- Example:
User Action: Select "Chicken breast, Brown rice, Spinach."
Output: The tool shows "Total: 450 kcal, 35g protein, 50g carbs, 10g fat" and allows users to save this combination as "Chicken and Rice Bowl."
2. Food Comparison Tool

- Description: Enable users to compare the nutritional content of two or more foods side by side, helping them make more informed decisions about which food to choose.
- How It Works:
Users select two or more foods to compare.
The tool displays the nutritional values of each food in a table, allowing users to see differences in calories, macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, etc.
- Optional: Highlight significant differences (e.g., one food is much higher in protein).

Additional Notes:

- Check the time estimates if they seem reasonable
- Make sure to update your progress on the gantt chart and fix initial dates
- Could find no way to express a weekly meeting in the gantt chart so ongoing tasks span most of the project duration
- Project start was taken from Meeting 2 date and phase 2 was estimated 4 weeks starting from the monday after phase 1 was due.
